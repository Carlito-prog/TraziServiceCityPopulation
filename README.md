# trazi-Population

# Given a csv file to download, I was told to create to end point one to get city/state population data, the other to update the data. Port has to be 5555, url should be formated in this manner api/population/state/state-val/city/city-val. Make sure the code is clean, high thorough output, plain javascript, and well structured code. Data has to persist, node 18, should be able to run 2 commands npm i, and npm start to boot up Trazi City State Population Server.

# My Plus:

# Clean & Documented - for better understanding

# Micro-services - built to scale

# Certain files OOP - running instances where it makes sense

# Redis - Use Mem Caching

# Use Nodemon - reboot server on changes, usually in Dev Environment

# No gitignore - need env files to connect to Mongo_DB and Redis

# Depending on request it should return an object containing the correct population in the DB.

# APP STARTS AT SERVER.JS LVL
